    <h3 class="statement"><span>14.1</span> A plane conducting loop is located in a uniform magnetic field that is directed along the x-axis. For what orientation of the loop is the flux a maximum? For what orientation is the flus a minimum?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">For constant potential in a region, the electric field is zero, as,
	<ul>
		<li>V<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub></li>
		<li>&Delta;V = V<sub>2</sub> - V<sub>1</sub> &Implies; &Delta;V = 0</li>
		<li>Now, as V = Ed &Implies; E = V/d</li>
		<li>E = 0</li>
	</ul>
	Hence, when potential difference is zero, electric field is also zero.

    <h3 class="statement"><span>14.2</span> A current in a conductor produces a magnetic field, which can be calculated using Ampere's law. Since current is defined as the rate of flow of charge, what can you conclude about the magnetic field due to stationary charges? What about moving charges?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Electric field intensity as well as electric potential will decrease by following electric field lines around a positive point charge, because electric field lines are directed away form positive charge so distance will increase when field line is followed, as
		<ul>
			<li>V = kq/r &Implies; V &propto; 1/r and E = kq/r<sup>2</sup> &Implies; E &propto; 1/r<sup>2</sup></li>

    <h4 class="answer">
		<ol>
			<li>
			<ul>
				<li>F<sub>1</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> = F - F = 0</li>
			</ul>
			Hence net. force will be zero.</li>
			<li>with opposite and equal charges: In this case, both forces are equal and in same direction.

    <h3 class="statement"><span>14.5</span> Two charged particles are projected in to a region where there is a magnetic field perpendicular to their velocities. If the charges are deflected in opposite directions, what can you say about them?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Electric field lines cannot intersect each other because these are the paths followed by resultant electrostatic force on test charge, which will always be single even if the electrostatic forces are more than one. This is because E has only one direction at any given point. If the lines cross, E would have two directions at a single point i.e. point of intersection of two field lines which is not possible.</h4>

    <h4 class="answer">Yes, q will make a rectilinear path, if its weight is neglected, since the field line is pointing in some direction, so the charge q will move along the line.</h4>
