    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.1</span> Bohr's theory of Hydrogen atom is based upon several assumptions. Do any of these assumptions contradict classical physics?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">For constant potential in a region, the electric field is zero, as,
	<ul>
		<li>V<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub></li>
		<li>&Delta;V = V<sub>2</sub> - V<sub>1</sub> &Implies; &Delta;V = 0</li>
		<li>Now, as V = Ed &Implies; E = V/d</li>
		<li>E = 0</li>
	</ul>
	Hence, when potential difference is zero, electric field is also zero.

    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.2</span> What is meant by a line spectrum? Explain how line spectrum can be used for the identification of elements?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Electric field intensity as well as electric potential will decrease by following electric field lines around a positive point charge, because electric field lines are directed away form positive charge so distance will increase when field line is followed, as
		<ul>
			<li>V = kq/r &Implies; V &propto; 1/r and E = kq/r<sup>2</sup> &Implies; E &propto; 1/r<sup>2</sup></li>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.3</span> Can the electron in the ground state of Hydrogen absorb a photon of energy 13.6 eV and greater than 13.6 eV?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">We can identify the positively charged plate by following methods:
		<ul>
			<li>The plate connected with positive terminal of battery is positively charged while the other is negatively charged.</li>
			<li>We can use Gold leaf electroscope to determine the polarity of plates.</li>
			<li>When the charged capacitor is connected across a resistance, the current starts flowing from positively charged plate to negatively charged plate, until it is discharged completely.</li>

<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.4</span> How can the spectrum of Hydrogen contain so many lines when Hydrogen contains one electron?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<ol>
			<li>with similar and equal charges: In this case, both plates will attract or repel, depending on the charge, with force of same magnitude but opposite direction.
			<ul>
				<li>F<sub>1</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> = F - F = 0</li>
			</ul>
			Hence net. force will be zero.</li>
			<li>with opposite and equal charges: In this case, both forces are equal and in same direction.
			<ul>
				<li>F<sub>1</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> = F + F = 2F</li>
			</ul>
			Hence net. force is 2F.</li>
