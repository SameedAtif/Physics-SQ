<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>12.1</span> The potential is constant throughout a given region in space. Is the electric field zero or non-zero in this region? Explain.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">For constant potential in a region, the electric field is zero, as,
	<ul>
		<li>V<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub></li>
		<li>&Delta;V = V<sub>2</sub> - V<sub>1</sub> &Implies; &Delta;V = 0</li>
		<li>Now, as V = Ed &Implies; E = V/d</li>
		<li>E = 0</li>
	</ul>
	Hence, when potential difference is zero, electric field is also zero.
