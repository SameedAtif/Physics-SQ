<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>21.1</span> What are isotopes? What do they have in common and what are their differences?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">For constant potential in a region, the electric field is zero, as,
	<ul>
		<li>V<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub></li>
		<li>&Delta;V = V<sub>2</sub> - V<sub>1</sub> &Implies; &Delta;V = 0</li>
		<li>Now, as V = Ed &Implies; E = V/d</li>
		<li>E = 0</li>
	</ul>
	Hence, when potential difference is zero, electric field is also zero.

<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>21.2</span> Why are heavy nuclei unstable?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Electric field intensity as well as electric potential will decrease by following electric field lines around a positive point charge, because electric field lines are directed away form positive charge so distance will increase when field line is followed, as
		<ul>
			<li>V = kq/r &Implies; V &propto; 1/r and E = kq/r<sup>2</sup> &Implies; E &propto; 1/r<sup>2</sup></li>

    <h4 class="answer">We can identify the positively charged plate by following methods:
		<ul>
			<li>The plate connected with positive terminal of battery is positively charged while the other is negatively charged.</li>
			<li>We can use Gold leaf electroscope to determine the polarity of plates.</li>
			<li>When the charged capacitor is connected across a resistance, the current starts flowing from positively charged plate to negatively charged plate, until it is discharged completely.</li>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>21.4</span> What fraction of a radioactive sample decays after two half-lives have elapsed?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<ol>
			<li>with similar and equal charges: In this case, both plates will attract or repel, depending on the charge, with force of same magnitude but opposite direction.
			<ul>
				<li>F<sub>1</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> = F - F = 0</li>
			</ul>
			Hence net. force will be zero.</li>
			<li>with opposite and equal charges: In this case, both forces are equal and in same direction.
			<ul>
				<li>F<sub>1</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> = F + F = 2F</li>
			</ul>
			Hence net. force is 2F.</li>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>21.5</span> The radioactive element <sup>226</sup><sub>88</sub>Ra has a falf-life of 1.6 x 10<sup>3</sup> years. Since the Earth is about 5 billion years old, how can you explain why we still can find this element in nature?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Electric field lines cannot intersect each other because these are the paths followed by resultant electrostatic force on test charge, which will always be single even if the electrostatic forces are more than one. This is because E has only one direction at any given point. If the lines cross, E would have two directions at a single point i.e. point of intersection of two field lines which is not possible.</h4>
